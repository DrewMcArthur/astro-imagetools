  ### `position`

  **Type:** `"top" | "right top" | "right" | "right bottom" | "bottom" | "left bottom" | "left" | "left top" | "north" | "northeast" | "east" | "southeast" | "south" | "southwest" | "west" | "northwest" | "center" | "centre" | "cover" | "entropy" | "attention"`

  **Default:** `undefined`

  When both `width` and `height` are provided **AND** `fit` is is set to `cover` or `contain`, this directive can be used to set the position of the image.
