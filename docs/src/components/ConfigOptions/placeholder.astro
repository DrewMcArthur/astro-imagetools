  ### `placeholder`

  **Type:** `"dominantColor" | "blurred" | "tracedSVG" | "none"`

  **Default:** `"blurred"`

  The placeholder to be displayed while the image is loading.

  If `placeholder` is set to `"dominantColor"`, the dominant color of the source
  image will be used as the placeholder.

  If the value is set to `"blurred"`, a very low-resolution version of the
  provided image will be enlarged and used as the placeholder.

  If the value is set to `"tracedSVG"`, a traced SVG of the image will be used
  as the placeholder. If the value is set to `"none"`, no placeholder will be
  displayed.

  > **Note:** If the value is set to `"tracedSVG"`, the placeholder can be customized to be a **Posterized SVG** too. See the [**formatOptions**](#formatOptions) prop for more details.
