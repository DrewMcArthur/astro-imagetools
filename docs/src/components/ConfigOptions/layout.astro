  ### `layout`

  **Type:** `"constrained" | "fixed" | "fullWidth" | "fill"`

  **Default:** `"constrained"`

  The layout mode to determine the resizing behavior of the image in the
  browser.
  
  In `constrained` mode, the image will occupy full width of the container
  with `max-width` set to 100% its width. The height of the image will be calculated
  based on the aspect ratio of the image. The image will be scaled down to fit the
  container but won't be enlarged.
  
  In `fixed` mode, the image will have a fixed width
  and height. The `width` and `height` props will be used to set the width and height
  of the image. The image won't be scaled down nor enlarged.
  
  In `fullWidth` mode,
  the image will be scaled up or down to occupy the full width of the container.
  The height of the image will be calculated based on the aspect ratio of the image.

  In `fill` mode, the image will be scaled up or down to fill the entire width and
  height of the container.
