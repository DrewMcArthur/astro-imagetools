The `<Picture />` component is an Astro component that renders an optimized and responsive `<picture />` element. This component supports all the features that **Astro ImageTools** has to offer for regular images. It's perfect for advanced use cases where you need to offer **multiple source formats**, need **Art Direction**, and the **onload fade-in transition**. It's the component that you may want to use most of the times.

## Code Example

```astro
---
import { Picture } from "astro-imagetools/components";
---

<Picture
  src="/src/images/landscape.jpg"
  alt="A landscape image"
  artDirectives={[
    {
      src: "/src/images/portrait.jpg",
      media: "(orientation: potrait)",
    },
  ]}
/>
```

## Component Props

Below is the list of props that the `<Picture />` component accepts. Only the `src` and `alt` props are required.
